Songs that have a clear beat and are easy for beginners to hear, although some have a longer introduction before the beat kicks in. Playlists are roughly in order from slow to fast.

## Nightclub Two Step

These are focused more on the rhythm or Buddy Schwimmer style Nightclub.

## Cross-Step Waltz

One of my favorite things about Cross-Step is the variety of musical genres and tones.

## Hustle

Disco is always a good bet for a bright, higher-energy dance, but there are also a lot of modern pop and club songs with this beat, which tend to be a bit smoother.
