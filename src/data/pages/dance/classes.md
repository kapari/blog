## Group Classes

Anyone is welcome to dance whichever role they prefer. Leading and following are both fun in different ways!

**Newcomer** classes are designed for absolute beginners; no experience required.

**Beyond-Beginning** classes build up your social dance repertoire, start adding styling, and refine your technique to dance with a variety of partners.

**Intermediate/Advanced** classes start breaking the rules with more unusual rhythms, higher levels of connection, and technique-heavy patterns.

Unless specified otherwise, classes are once per week, starting at the beginning of the month.

### Nightclub Two-Step

A slower and wonderfully smooth dance that stays in one spot on the floor and ranges from romantic to dynamic. It can be danced to a variety of music styles and has a simpler rhythm that is great for beginners. In my classes, we'll be dancing the rhythm- or Buddy Schwimmer style (rock on 1).

### Cross-Step Waltz

A relaxed walking-style waltz danced at a moderate tempo (~100-130bpm). It travels around the floor and follows the flow of momentum more than many other dances. Revived by Stanford dance historian Richard Powers in the 1990s, the community around this dance is very open and inventive, and you'll see a variety of moves adapted from other dance styles.

### Country Two-Step

Perhaps the most popular country dance, this two-step travels around the floor and is for follows who love to turn! Like the name implies, the music is mainly country.

### Hustle

It's not just for disco, although that is definitely fun! Hustle is a faster dance that usually stays in one spot on the floor, and its inclusion of arm movements is great for practicing confidence (power pose!). Newcomer classes start out with 4-count (straight-time) hustle and then move on to 3-count (syncopated) hustle.
